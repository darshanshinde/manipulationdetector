to be run.

When run in MATLAB editor, the files 'FREY_SHINDE.m' & 'FREY_SHINDE2.m' draw lines along the points mentioned within the MATLAB code, thus showing the consistencies and inconsistencies in
the airport board in the 'edit_airport1.jpg' and 'edit_airport2.jpg' respectively.

When run in MATLAB editor, the files  'FREY_SHINDE3.m' & 'FREY_SHINDE4.m' draw lines along the points mentioned within the MATLAB code, thus showing the different distance between two pre-selected 
points on the same letters from different part of text area on the signboard.

The file Coordinates.txt contains the pre-selected coordinates along which the program draws lines to detect the consistencies in text plane or fonts.


Files:
edit_airport1.jpg, edit_airport2.jpg, S1.jpg, S2.jpg are the demo images we use to test
the effectiveness of our MATLAB program.
